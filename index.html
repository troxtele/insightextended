                      To begin, you need to add funds to your portfolio. Click
                      on the "$" sign to add funds to your portfolio. You can
                      enter the amount of funds you want to add to your
                      portfolio. You would be able to use this option in future
                      to make adjustments to your portfolio's capital based on
                      changes in your investment strategy or financial needs.
                      All fund transactions, including additions and
                      withdrawals, are logged and presented in the fund history

                      unit price, which is set at 1 USD by default. This initial
                      unit price serves as a reference point for tracking the
                      performance of your investments. (!) Note: when recording

                      maintain accurate portfolio numbers, you will need to
                      manually enter the exact figures from your trading system
                      or brokerage account. This ensures that your portfolio
                      reflects your actual holdings and provides accurate

                    The Daily P&L (Profit and Loss) provides you with a measure
                    of the daily gains or losses in your portfolio's value. It
                    represents the change in the value of your portfolio on a
                    day-to-day basis, helping you track the performance and
                    fluctuations of your investments over time.

                    The Sharpe Ratio is a metric that assesses the risk-adjusted
                    return of your portfolio. It measures the excess return
                    generated by your portfolio compared to a risk-free
                    investment, relative to the volatility of the portfolio. A
                    higher Sharpe Ratio indicates a better risk-adjusted
                    performance, as it signifies higher returns for the amount
                    of risk taken.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Sharpe Ratio calculations are based on the performance
                    of your portfolio over a three-month period. They provide
                    valuable insights into risk characteristics of your
                    investments, allowing you to evaluate and analyze the
                    performance of your portfolio.

                    The performance graph on the portfolio management provides a
                    visual representation of the percentage change in your
                    portfolio's value over time. It allows you to track the
                    performance of your investments and gain insights into their
                    growth or decline. By displaying the historical performance,
                    you can analyze trends, identify patterns, and assess the
                    overall progress of your portfolio.

                  <p>
                    Additionally, the performance graph allows you to compare
                    your portfolio's performance against a benchmark. This
                    benchmark can be a relevant market index or another
                    investment vehicle that serves as a reference point. By
                    comparing your portfolio's performance to the benchmark, you
                    can evaluate how well your investments are performing
                    relative to the broader market or a specific benchmark
                    index.

                  <p>
                    The performance graph offers a valuable tool for monitoring
                    and assessing the performance of your portfolio, allowing
                    you to make informed decisions based on historical data and
                    performance trends. It helps you gauge the success of your
                    investment strategy and provides insights into the relative
                    performance of your portfolio compared to market benchmarks.

                    Symbol reached target price: <br />
                    This event occurs when the price of a symbol reaches its
                    predefined target price. It serves as a notification that
                    the symbol has achieved the desired price level, which could
                    be a signal for potential actions such as selling the
                    position or reassessing the investment strategy.

                    ymbol price below MA50: <br />
                    When the price of a symbol falls below its 50-day moving
                    average (MA50), this event is triggered. It indicates that
                    the current price is lower than the average price over the
                    past 50 days. This event may suggest a potential downturn or
                    weakening trend, prompting investors to monitor the symbol
                    closely for further analysis or potential adjustments to
                    their portfolio.

                    Similar to the previous event, this monitoring event occurs
                    when the price of a symbol drops below its 100-day moving
                    average (MA100). It indicates that the current price is
                    lower than the average price observed over the past 100
                    days. This event may signal a more significant shift in the
                    symbol's trend or potential long-term weakness, warranting
                    further attention and analysis.

                    Symbol earning date nearing: <br />
                    This event notifies users when the earning date for a symbol
                    is approaching. The earning date refers to the scheduled
                    date on which a company will release its financial results,
                    including revenue, earnings, and other key metrics.
                    Monitoring this event allows investors to stay informed
                    about upcoming earnings announcements, which can impact the
                    market perception and potentially influence the price and
                    performance of the symbol. Being aware of the earning date
                    enables investors to plan their actions and evaluate the
                    potential implications on their investment decisions.

                    The Sharpe Ratio is a metric that assesses the risk-adjusted
                    return of your portfolio. It measures the excess return
                    generated by your portfolio compared to a risk-free
                    investment, relative to the volatility of the portfolio. A
                    higher Sharpe Ratio indicates a better risk-adjusted
                    performance, as it signifies higher returns for the amount
                    of risk taken.

                        It is recommended to utilize the notes feature in the

                      Please remember that closing a position involves selling

                      your portfolio. It is crucial to carefully evaluate and
                      consider the decision to close a position, taking into
                      account your investment strategy, objectives, and market
                      conditions. By using the "Close Position" function, you
                      can effectively manage your portfolio and track the
                      performance of your investments. Remember to update the

                    The funds history audit log serves as a record of all the
                    actions and events that have occurred in your portfolio. It

                    units or shares involved, unit price, amount, and any
                    additional comments. By scrolling to the bottom of the page,
                    you can access the fund history and review the chronological
                    list of recorded actions. The fund history log is a valuable
                    resource for tracking and auditing the changes and
                    transactions made in your portfolio. It helps you maintain
                    an accurate record of your portfolio's activity and provides
                    transparency and accountability for all actions taken.

                    It is essential to provide the entry date for each position
                    you add to your portfolio. This allows for accurate tracking
                    of the timing of your investments, enabling you to analyze
                    performance and make informed decisions based on historical
                    data.
